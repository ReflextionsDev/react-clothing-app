# Build a web app using React JS. (Make sure to leverage switch statements).

- As a user, the app should tell me what to wear based on the day of the week.
- The app should automatically show a combination of clothing items selected at random. One for each type of clothing. (top, bottom, shoes).
- For Weekdays all the clothing items should be of type formal.
- For Saturdays, the clothing items selected should be casual.
- For Sundays, the clothing items selected should be sport.
- The app should allow you to generate an outfit based on type (‘formal’, ‘casual, ‘sport’) with the click of a button.
- There should be a try again button that regenerates the clothing combination.
